# The Machine Learning Lifecycle Outline

*   High level introduction (15 minutes): 
    *   What is machine learning?
    *   3 Major types of ML:
        *   Supervised learning. (classification and regression)
        *   Unsupervised learning
        *   Reinforcement learning.
    *   How is this software being used elsewhere? **discussion**
    *   Structured data vs unstructured data
        *   Unstructured: NLP, computer vision
        *   Structured: financial forecasting, voter forecasting, and most other tasks.  

*   Strengths and weaknesses of ML (15 minutes):
    *   How can we evaluate if ML is a good fit for a particular problem?
    *   What are the major sources of risk in an ML project?
    *   “Black box” vs interpretable models. 
    *   Data quality and bias.  

* Training and Model Evaluation (15 minutes)
    * Training vs Test vs Validation data
    * Underfitting vs Overfitting
    * (briefly) Choice of metrics for evaluation.

*   What goes into making an ML product? (10 minutes)
    *   Name the parts of the ML lifecycle.
    *   Briefly describe each one.
        *   Define the objectives.
        *   Acquire, explore, and clean the data.
        *   Modeling.
        *   Interpret and communicate the results.
        *   Implement, document & deploy.
        *   Monitor, and maintain the system.
