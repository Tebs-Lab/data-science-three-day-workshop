# Linear Regression and Logistic Regression

In this class we'll learn about:

* Two new models
    * Linear regression
    * Logistic regression
* Concepts and tools related to data preparation:
    * Feature engineering
    * Feature normalization
* Concepts and tools for measuring model performance and model selection:
    * For classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Specificity
    * The "confusion matrix"
    * For regression: r2, MSE, MAE
    * Tracking and reporting metrics in SK-learn
    * KFold Cross Validation
