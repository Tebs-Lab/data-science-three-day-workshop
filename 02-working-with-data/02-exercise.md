# Exercise: Exploring Data With Jupyter, Pandas, and Matplotlib

This exercise is meant to help you practice:

* Reading documentation and using unfamiliar libraries.
* Writing and executing code in Jupyter Notebooks.
* Manipulating data with `pandas`.
* Creating charts with `matplotlib`.

# The Exercise

You will be exploring the NYC property dataset and creating some charts that help you describe the data therein. Create a new Jupyter notebook and then use `pandas` and `matplotlib` to discover the following facts and create the following charts. Keep in mind that you may need to coerce, filter, or manipulate the data before you can create the chart.

> Remember, one of the primary skills you are developing is the ability to read documentation and find tutorials. The provided materials in this repo do not contain an example of each of these charts *by design*. Finding information, tutorials, and documentation is a key skill in the life of a software engineer or data scientist!

## Fact Finding:

Find the answer to each of these questions:

* What was the most expensive property sold in the dataset?
* How many sales were for less than $10
    * How could this possibly be right? (Hint: read the data documentation on Kaggle...)
* How many of the properties sold were built prior to 1950?
* What is the smallest gross square feet property sold?
    * What was the largest?
* Which zip code had the fewest number of sales?

## Chart Making:

Create the following charts:

* A bar chart showing how many properties were sold in each borough.
    * Use the data documentation to find the names of each borough rather than the 1-5 values.
* A pie chart showing the share of sales by borough.
    * Use the data documentation to find the names of each borough rather than the 1-5 values.
* A bar chart showing the average (mean) sale price of property in each zip code.
* A scatterplot showing the sales price by the gross square feet.
    * **Bonus points**: show the least squares regression line as well!

## Challenge Yourself:

A good data scientist is curious about data. This is honestly a pretty interesting dataset. Explore the data on your own and find the answer to a question you have, or create charts you want to see personally!

Consider:

* Making another kind of chart, matplotlib supports MANY chart types and we've only seen a few.
* Computing some more statistics about the data, we've only seen fundamental stuff like mean and standard deviation. 
* The world is your oyster, follow your heart (or mind)!
