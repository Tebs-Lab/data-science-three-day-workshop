# Exercise: Applying Metrics for Classification

In this exercise you'll be broken into small teams and asked to discuss the application of different metrics for a few classification tasks. After each topic, we'll discuss the results as a class.

## Discussion Topics:

In your discussion, attempt to answer these questions:

1. Define the following in terms of the problem:
    * False positive
    * False negative
    * True positive
    * True negative
2. What are the costs or risks associated with false positives and false negatives in terms of this problem?
3. Define the following in terms of the problem:
    * Accuracy
    * Recall 
    * Specificity
    * Precision 
4. For each of those four metrics, which ones seem most important overall?
    * Try to define a minimum acceptable value for each one.
5. Are there other metrics you'd like to track?

You'll be asked to discuss each topic for about 15 minutes, then we'll discuss as a group.

## The ML Applications:

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection

This system is a binary classification system that attempts to identify fraudulent purchases made with a credit card.

### 2. Email Spam Filtering

This system is a binary classification system that attempts to classify emails as spam or real.

### 3. Cancer Screening

This system is a binary classification system that attempts to classify a radiographic image as either containing or not containing an instance of a cancerous tumor.

### 4. Facial Recognition

This system is a multiclass classification system that attempts to map an image of a person's face to that persons identity. When considering the costs, risks, and important metrics of this system consider the application of this system for two distinct purposes:

1. For use by law enforcement.
2. To unlock a phone, computer, tablet or other similar devices.

Would you value different metrics in these different cases?
